Feature: Real-time Order Tracking
  As a customer or driver
  I want to track order progress and location
  So that I can monitor delivery status

  Background:
    Given the P2P delivery platform is running
    And the database is clean and initialized
    And test customer "John Customer" with email "john@example.com" exists
    And test driver "Jane Driver" with email "jane@example.com" exists
    And order "ORD-001" exists with status "in_transit"
    And driver is assigned to order
    And the system time is "2025-10-19T12:00:00Z"
