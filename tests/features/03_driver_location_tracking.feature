Feature: Driver Location Tracking and Order Filtering
  As a driver
  I want to update my location and view nearby orders
  So that I can find delivery opportunities efficiently

  Background:
    Given the P2P delivery platform is running
    And the database is clean and initialized
    And test driver "Jane Driver" is logged in with email "jane@example.com"
    And the system time is "2025-10-19T12:00:00Z"

  Scenario: Driver updates location manually
    Given I am on the driver dashboard
    And I have location permission granted
    When I click "Update Location" button
    Then my browser should request geolocation permission
    And my location should be updated to coordinates:
      | lat | 40.7128 |
      | lng | -74.0060 |
    Then I should see success indicator "Location Updated"
    And the button should turn green
    And I should see my coordinates displayed:
      """
      üìç Lat: 40.7128, Lng: -74.0060
      """
    And my location should be stored in driver_locations table

    When I deny the permission
    Then I should see error message "Location access denied"
    And the location status should show "‚ùå Location access denied"

    When I update my location to:
      | lat | 40.7128 |
      | lng | -74.0060 |
    Then the available orders list should refresh automatically
    And I should see only orders within 5km of my location
    And each order should show distance to pickup location

  @LOC-005 @data_persistence
  Scenario: Driver location persists across sessions
    Given I have updated my location to:
      | lat | 40.7128 |
      | lng | -74.0060 |
    When I logout and login again
    Then my saved location should be displayed
    And the last updated timestamp should be shown
    And location should be retrieved from driver_locations table

  @LOC-006 @api
  Scenario: Get driver current location via API
    Given I have updated my location to:
      | lat | 40.7580 |
      | lng | -73.9855 |

    Then I should receive response:
      | latitude    | 40.7580 |
      | longitude   | -73.9855 |
      | lastUpdated | 2025-10-19T12:00:00Z |

  @LOC-007 @api @validation
  Scenario: Update driver location via API with valid coordinates
    Given I am authenticated as a driver
    When I POST to "/api/drivers/location" with:
      | latitude  | 40.7128 |
      | longitude | -74.0060 |
    Then I should receive success response "Location updated successfully"
    And the response should include:
      | latitude  | 40.7128 |
      | longitude | -74.0060 |

  @LOC-008 @validation
  Scenario: Location update fails with invalid coordinates
    Given I am authenticated as a driver
    When I attempt to update location with invalid data:
      | latitude  | 95.0000 |  # Invalid: > 90

    And I should see confirmation of successful update

  @LOC-012 @data_validation
  Scenario: Location coordinates are validated
    When I attempt to update location with coordinates:
      | latitude  | <lat>  |

    Examples:
      | lat      | lng       | result  |
