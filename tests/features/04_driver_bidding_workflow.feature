Feature: Driver Bidding and Order Acceptance

  So that I can secure delivery jobs

    Given the P2P delivery platform is running
    And the database is clean and initialized
    And test customer "John Customer" with email "john@example.com" exists
    And test driver "Jane Driver" is logged in with email "jane@example.com"
    And driver has updated location to:
      | lat | 40.7128 |
      | lng | -74.0060 |
    And customer has created order "ORD-001" with:
      | title           | Laptop Delivery       |
      | price           | 25.00                 |
      | status          | pending_bids          |
